Project to learn on some OOP concepts from the book "Sam' Teach Yourself Object Oriented Programming"

The code here is drawn from the assignments in the book with slight variations that:

1) I felt help me learn better.

2) Incorporated newer Java features since this book was published

Package description:

1) casino: deals with encapsulation

2) bank: deals with inheritance

3) personality: deals with inclusion polymorphism

4) payroll: deals with inclusion polymorphism
